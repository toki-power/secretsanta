Should you appreciate this tool so much that you'd like to thank me, you can either drop a friendly note in this repository's issues, or be a [one-time sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/arcanis?frequency=one-time&sponsor=arcanis). Either would make my day 😊

## Docker Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your system
- Docker Compose (optional, for easier deployment)

### Building and Running with Docker

#### Option 1: Using Docker directly

1. Build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t secretsanta .
```

2. Run the container:
```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name secretsanta-app secretsanta
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

#### Option 2: Using Docker Compose

1. Build and start the container:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

2. To view logs:
```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

3. To stop the container:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Custom Port

To run on a different port, set the `PORT` environment variable:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -e PORT=8080 --name secretsanta-app secretsanta
```

Or in `docker-compose.yml`, modify the ports and environment sections.

### Production Deployment

For production, you may want to:
- Use a reverse proxy (nginx, traefik, etc.)
- Set up SSL/TLS certificates
- Configure environment variables
- Use a container orchestration platform (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, etc.)
